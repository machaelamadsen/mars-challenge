This challenge is broken into two parts: 
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.# mars-challenge.
Part 1 utilized Beautiful Soup to extract elements from the Mars website text. I then created a python list with the extracted text.
Part 2 uses Beautiful Soup to scrape a table and create it as a Pandas data frame. I was then able to create visualizations with MatPlot to further examine the data.
